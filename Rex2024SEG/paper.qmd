## Introduction

Common-image gathers (CIGs) are pivotal in migration-velocity analysis (MVA). However, MVA is often hindered by the computational burden of traditional migration methods. To bypass these limitations, we introduce a neural surrogate learning approach that utilizes Fourier Neural Operators [FNOs, @fno] to accelerate MVA. Following the velocity-continuation scheme of @siahkoohi2022velocity, we train a survey-specific FNO to map the CIGs associated with one migration-velocity model to another without remigration. This methodology leverages the capacity of FNOs to approximate complex PDE-based mappings rendering computational cost at inference negligible, thereby expediting MVA.
<!-- 
If optimization ends up working by Friday :

$L =-\sum_i\frac{E_i}{i}$

$E_i = \frac{fft(CIG[-i:i])}{fft(CIG)}$

Where $E_i$ represents the $\%$ of energy contained in offsets that are at most $|i|$ offsets away from the 0 offset. 

NOTE: The fft is taken along the offset dimension -->

## Methodology

We conduct a case study on a 2D slice of the Compass model. We generate the observed data with 64 sources and 256 ocean bottom nodes, using a Ricker wavelet with central frequency of 0.015 Hz. We assume absorbing boundaries in our study. We add uncorrelated band-limited noise with an SNR of 12 dB for realism. We use 500 migration-velocity models and generate their CIGs to form our training dataset (Figure 1.c). Next, we train an FNO to map pairs of $1)$ an initial migration velocity model, $2)$ its associated CIGs, and $3)$ a target migration-velocity model, to the CIGs associated with the target velocity model (Figure 1.d).

## Conclusion

Figure 2 displays the FNO prediction in the subsurface-offset domain across various velocity models in an unseen test dataset. Despite some minor errors, the FNO prediction successfully captures the focusing pattern of the CIGs, and correctly produces the imaged reflectivities in the zero-offset. Computationally, the upfront training cost could potentially be reduced by transfer learning techniques. At inference, our trained FNO achieves $3200\times$ speed-up compared to numerical computation of CIGs. These findings substantiate the efficiency of the FNOs in generating CIGs for many velocity models, underscoring its applicability in real-time MVA. This accelerated MVA framework could pave the way for quantifying the uncertainty of imaged reflectivities with respect to many velocity models, and also help select velocity models that lead to desired properties in CIGs. This framework will naturally become a postprocessor for velocity models produced by generative artificial intelligence workflows [@wise].
