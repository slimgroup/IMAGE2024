## Objectives and scope
The primary objective of this study is to approximate the velocity model in seismic imaging such that the Common Image Gathers (CIGs) exhibit specific characteristics, such as focusing energy in the center. This approach aims to enhance the clarity and quality of velocity models, which is critical for accurate seismic imaging. The scope involves using Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) as a surrogate machine learning model to train and refine velocity models based on their associated CIGs.

## Method
The method involves three key steps:

1. **Initial Data Preparation**: Starting with a single velocity model $x_0$ and its corresponding CIG ($CIG_0$), we generate training samples by slightly altering the velocity model ($x + \epsilon$) and simulating CIGs from these modified models.
2. **Surrogate Model Training**: A surrogate machine learning model $G$ is trained to understand the relationship between the velocity models and their corresponding CIGs st. $G(x_0, x_i, CIG_0) = CIG_i$
3. **Optimization**: We then solve for a velocity model where a predefined function $f$ ensures a lower value for the desired properties of CIGs, such as energy focusing. $min_{x} f(G_{\theta}(x, x_0, CIG_0))$

## Results
Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the FNO in rapidly predicting CIGs for new velocity models, highlighting the potential for its application in real-time seismic data analysis. The method shows promise in focusing on desirable properties in CIGs, like energy distribution across different offsets.

## Introduction
This section provides an overview of Fourier Neural Operators and their application in seismic imaging, particularly in velocity continuation and CIG mapping.


## Methodology
Details of the 3D FNO training process, data preparation, and model specifications are discussed here, along with computational considerations for scaling to 4D models.


## Synthetic case studies
We present several synthetic case studies to validate our approach, comparing the FNO-generated CIGs with those from traditional methods.


## Discussion and conclusions
The implications of the findings for seismic imaging and potential areas for future research are discussed.
