## Abstract

Diffusion generative models are emerging powerful frameworks for learning high-dimensional distributions and synthezing high-quality images. However, their efficacy in training predominantly hinges on the availability of complete, high-quality datasets, a condition that often proves unattainable, particularly in the domain related to subsurface velocity-model generation. In this work, we propose to synthesize subsurface velocities from incomplete models (limited field observations or wells) by integrating additional observation distortions during the training phase and formulating a supervised loss objective. 
Our approach facilitates the generation of full velocity samples utilizing a dataset composed merely of seismic images and 5 wells per seismic image. Upon concluding the training process, our framework permits the generation of velocity samples from novel RTMs without the necessity for wells or incomplete velocity measurements.

## Method

Seismic velocity-model synthesis from incomplete measurements is an ill-posed problem, and acquiring comprehensive realistic datasets is costly. Generative models, particularly diffusion models, offer a solution by training conditional networks to synthesize plausible samples. These models approach synthesis through a denoising process, facilitating high-quality generation within high-dimensional spaces. Our work leverages diffusion models to construct velocities from limited well log information and thereby showcase their efficiency in generating geophysically sound velocity samples.

For our training dataset, we utilize 2D proxy velocity slices (measuring 1600m in both depth and width) that reflect the geological characteristics of the Southern North Sea [@bg]. These models are derived from 3D imaged seismic and well-log data, featuring realistic heterogeneity. To simulate authentic field conditions, we apply a column-wise random masking ($\mathbf{A}$) to velocity slices leaving only 5 well per slice, resulting in approximately $\approx 98\%$ of the velocity information being obscured.Alongside, we generate seismic images from our velocity slices using Reverse Time Migration (RTM) and form a dataset that includes 3000 RTMs and a total of 15000 wells.

In our training process, the absence of complete velocity models precludes the use of a conventional L2 denoising loss formulation. Inspired by [@rafaelkriging] and [@ambient], our study adopts an alternative approach by introducing distortion into the already column-wise masked, and there for distorted, velocity models ($\mathbf{\hat{A}}$). This approach crafts a supervised learning objective, where the denoising model, conditioned on seismic images ($\mathbf{c}$), aims to perform both denoising and inpainting of missing pixels using the distorted and masked velocity models as input. Figure 1 illustrates the conceptual framework of the loss objective and specifies the inputs for the denoising network, which is charged with the generation of clean velocity models. The denoising model undergoes training over 20,000 iterations on 2 A100 GPUs for approximately 4 days.

In the formulation of our training loss, field observations (RTMs and wells) along with column-wise masks ($\mathbf{A}$) are initially sampled. Following this, distortion masks ($\mathbf{\hat{A}}$) are generated, with their sampling conditioned upon the initial column-wise masks. The denoising model, informed of the distortion masks, noisy distorted well information and RTMs reconstructs the complete, noise-free velocity model.

## Results

In Figure 2, we present the performance of our generative model across two distinct examples. Using an unseen seismic image (RTM), our model synthesizes subsurface velocity without relying on well data, effectively executing a deconvolution operation. To validate the quality of our generation process, we compare the posterior means (derived from 200 samples) against the ground truth test velocity models, which remained entirely unseen during the training phase. We observe that posterior means can capture long range structures and produce meaningful velocity samples, evidenced by Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) scores of 0.88 and 0.91. Furthermore, we calculated the variance of the posterior samples that aligns closely with particular structures within the velocity models. We can conclude that our method is a promising option for generating realistic velocity models. Looking ahead, future directions include expanding our dataset across varied geological settings and advancing towards a foundational seismic-based velocity generative model.

The denoising model is tested on two distinct, previously unseen velocity examples. For each case, we fed the corresponding RTM into the network and generated velocity samples (200 samples for each example). Subsequently, we computed both the posterior mean and variance. To assess the accuracy of our model, we included the SSIM score comparing the ground truth to the calculated posterior means.

## Significance

We utilized diffusion models to synthesize realistic subsurface velocity samples. Unlike prior approaches dependent on entirely complete velocity datasets, our method achieves effective training with merely $\approx 2%$ of velocity information (well data) and corresponding Reverse Time Migrations (RTMs) for each velocity slice. Additionally, our model's sampling mechanism operates without the necessity for well data, conditioned solely on RTMs to generate velocity samples directly. The velocity samples produced by our technique are highly beneficial for subsequent tasks in reservoir engineering and other fields demanding the creation of various plausible velocity models.
