    "text": "Methodology\nTo make uncertainty informed decisions on adapting the injection rate, 128 samples of the state (see second row Figure 1), \\(\\{\\mathbf{x}^{(m)}_{3}\\}_{m=1}^{128}\\), and permeability, \\(\\{K^{(m)}\\}_{m=1}^{128}\\), are drawn at time-step \\(k=3\\) from the posterior distribution, \\(\\mathbf{x}_{3}\\sim p(\\mathbf{x}_{3}\\vert \\mathbf{y}^\\mathrm{o}_{1:3})\\), for the state conditioned on the observed time-lapse data, and from the distribution for the permeability, \\(K\\sim p(K)\\). To find the optimized injection rate, we first calculate for each sample, \\(K\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(m)}_{3}\\), the optimized injectivity by \\(\\max_{q_3} q_3\\Delta t \\ \\ \\text{subject to} \\ \\ \\mathbf{x}_{4}['p']&lt;\\mathbf{p}_{\\max}\\) where \\(\\mathbf{p}_{\\max}\\) is the depth-dependent fracture pressure, and \\(\\mathbf{x}_{4}=\\mathcal{M}_3(\\mathbf{x}_{3}, \\mathbf{K}; q_3)\\) the state’s time-advancement denoted by the symbol \\(\\mathcal{M}_3\\). For the fluid-flow simulations, the open-source Julia package JUDI.jl and JutulDarcy.jl are used. Results of these optimizations are included in Figure 2(a), which contains a histogram of the empirical fracture frequency as a function of injection rates at time \\(k=3\\). Given this histogram, our task is to maximize the injection rate given a pre-defined confidence interval (e.g. 95 %), so that the fracture probability remains below a certain percentage e.g. 1%. With these simulations, and the fact that fracture/no-fracture occurrences are distributed according to the Bernoulli distribution, we will demonstrate that we are able to select an injection rate that limits fracture occurrence to the prescribed probability with a prescribed confidence interval. For instance, we can compute \\(Pr([\\mathbf{x}_4['p']&gt;p_{\\max}]&lt;0.01)&lt;1-0.025\\), which corresponds to selecting an injection rate that leads to fracture rate of \\(&lt;1\\%\\) with \\(97.5\\%\\) confidence. The confidence interval is halved, because only conservative (left) injection rates will be selected (see Figure 2(b)).",

    "text": "Results\nTo calculate injection rates that mitigate the risk of exceeding the fracture pressure, we proceed as follows. First, because the optimized injection rates are close to the fracture pressure, we consider these optimization as approximations to the injection rates where the fracture pressure are exceeded. Next, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is applied to produce the smooth red curve in Figure 2(a). This smoothed probability function is used to calculate the Cumulative Density Function (CDF), plotted in Figure 2(b). Using the fact that non-fracture/fracture occurrence entails a Bernoulli distribution, confidence intervals can be calculated, \\(\\pm Z_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{128}}\\) where \\(\\hat{p}\\) represents the CDF (blue line) and \\(Z_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}=1.96\\) with \\(\\alpha=0.05\\). From the CDF and confidence intervals (denoted by the grey areas), the following conclusions can be drawn: First, if the initial injection rate of \\(q_3 = 0.0500 m^3/s\\) is kept, the fracture probability lies between 24.47 – 40.71% (vertical dashed line) and has a maximum likelihood of 32.59%, which are all way too high. Second, if we want to limit the fracture occurrence rate to 1% (red dashed line), then we need to lower the injection rate to \\(q_3=0.0387\\mathrm{m^3/s}\\). To ensure the low fracture occurrence rate of 1%, the reduced injection rate is chosen as the smallest injection rate within the confidence interval. As can be observed from Figure 2(b), lowering the injection rate avoids exceeding the fracture pressure at the expense of injecting less CO2. Out of 128 samples, 43 samples are fractured with the initial injection rate, while only one sample is fractured with the controlled injection rate.",

Specifically, we used the Digital Twin’s capability to produce samples of its state (pressure), conditioned on observed seismic and/or well data. Using these samples, in conjunction with samples from the permeability distribution, we were able to capture statistics on the fracture occurrence frequency as a function of the injection rate. Given these statistics, we were in a position to set a fracture frequency and choose the corresponding injection rate as a function of the confidence interval. By following this procedure, exceeding the fracture pressure was avoided by lowering the injection rate. The decision to lower the injection rate, and by which amount, was informed by the Digital Twin, which uses seismic and/or well data to capture reservoir’s state including its uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Pressure state at time-step \\(k=3\\) and a comparative analysis of pressure outputs from the digital twin at time-step \\(k=4\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Injection rate samples and KDE curve(a), CDF curve of fracture probability versus injection rate with 95% confidence interval(b)",

    "text": "Introduction\nCommon-image gathers (CIGs) are pivotal in migration-velocity analysis (MVA). However, MVA is often hindered by the computational burden of traditional migration methods. To bypass these limitations, we introduce a neural-surrogate learning approach that utilizes Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs, Li et al. 2020) to accelerate MVA. Following the velocity-continuation scheme of Siahkoohi, Louboutin, and Herrmann (2022), we train a survey-specific FNO to map the CIGs associated with one migration-velocity model to another without remigration. This methodology leverages the capacity of FNOs to approximate complex PDE-based mappings, rendering computational cost at inference negligible, thereby expediting MVA. By enabling rapid generation and evaluation of CIGs across various velocity models, it offers a pathway to quickly examine velocity models according to preferred properties and to quantify uncertainties in imaged reflectivities at the same time. Additionally, this methodology paves the way for inverse design optimization, updating velocity models to produce CIGs with desirable characteristics.",

    "text": "Results\nFigure 2 displays the FNO prediction in the subsurface-offset domain across various velocity models in an unseen test dataset. Despite some minor errors, the FNO prediction successfully captures the focusing pattern of the CIGs, and correctly produces the imaged reflectivities at the near zero-offsets. Computationally, the upfront training cost could potentially be reduced by transfer learning techniques. At inference, our trained FNO achieves \\(3200\\times\\) speed-up compared to numerical computation of CIGs. These findings substantiate the computational efficiency of the FNOs in generating CIGs for many velocity models, underscoring its applicability in real-time migration-velocity analysis. This framework also presents a way to select good posterior samples of velocity models so that they exhibit desirable properties in their CIGs, making it a good choice of a postprocessor for velocity models produced by generative artificial intelligence workflows (Yin et al. 2023). Additionally, it enables fast uncertainty quantification of imaged reflectivities with respect to many velocity models. In addition to this, the framework could also be pivotal in performing inverse design optimization. By updating our background velocity models such that they yield CIGs with specific, desirable properties, we can further refine our understanding of seismic data. This work is made reproducible at FNO-CIG using distributed Fourier Neural Operators implemented in ParametricOperators.jl.",

Instead of seeking only a single velocity model, our method aims to draw samples from the posterior distribution of migration-velocity models conditioned on the observed shot data. In this context, we train conditional normalizing flows (CNFs) to approximate this posterior distribution. To simplify the mapping between seismic image and shot data, we use common-image gathers (CIGs) as an information-preserving physics-informed summary statistic to embed the shot data, and then train the CNFs on pairs of velocity models and CIGs. After training, the inverse of CNF turns random realizations of the standard Gaussian distribution into posterior samples (velocity models) conditioned on any seismic observation that is in the same statistical distribution as the training data, shown in the upper part of the flowchart. We term this amortized inference framework WISE, short for full-Waveform variational Inference via Subsurface Extensions (Yin et al. 2023).

To meet this challenge and bridge the so-called amortization gap, we apply a physics-based refinement approach to fine-tune the trained network. We compose a shallower invertible network with the trained CNFs, where the shallower network is initialized with random weights and acts on the latent space. Following a transfer learning scheme, we freeze the weights of the trained CNF and only update the weights of the shallower network in order for the posterior samples to fit the observed shot data.
