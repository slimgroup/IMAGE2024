    "section": "Amortized variational inference",
    "text": "Amortized variational inference\nOur method concerns estimation of migration-velocity models from noisy seismic data through the inversion of the wave modeling operator. Instead of seeking only a single velocity model, our method aims to draw samples from the posterior distribution of migration-velocity models conditioned on the observed shot data. In this context, we train conditional normalizing flows (CNFs) to approximate this posterior distribution. To simplify the mapping between seismic image and shot data, we use common-image gathers (CIGs) as an information-preserving physics-informed summary statistic to embed the shot data, and then train the CNFs on pairs of velocity models and CIGs. After training, the inverse of CNF turns random realizations of the standard Gaussian distribution into posterior samples (velocity models) conditioned on any seismic observation that is in the same statistical distribution as the training data, shown in the upper part of the flowchart. We term this amortized inference framework WISE, short for full-Waveform variational Inference via Subsurface Extensions (Yin et al. 2023). We further propose a physics-based Refinement approach to make it WISER.",

    "section": "Physics-based refinement",
    "text": "Physics-based refinement\nWhile the trained amortized CNF can generate posterior velocity samples instantaneously at inference, the accuracy of CNFs might be deteriorated due to out-of-distribution issues — i.e., the observed data is generated by an out-of-distribution velocity model, or through a slightly different forward modeling operator (e.g. acoustic-elastic, differing source function, attenuation effect, unremoved shear wave energy, etc). To meet this challenge and bridge the so-called amortization gap, we apply a physics-based refinement approach to fine-tune the trained network. We compose a shallower invertible network with the trained CNFs, where the shallower network is initialized with random weights and acts on the latent space. Following a transfer learning scheme, we freeze the weights of the trained CNF and only update the weights of the shallower network in order for the posterior samples to fit the observed shot data. This process is shown in the lower part of the flowchart in red color.",
