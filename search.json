    "section": "Methodology",
    "text": "Methodology\nTo make uncertainty informed decisions on adapting the injection rate, 128 samples of the state (see second row Figure 1), \\(\\{\\mathbf{x}^{(m)}_{3}\\}_{m=1}^{128}\\), and permeability, \\(\\{K^{(m)}\\}_{m=1}^{128}\\), are drawn at time-step \\(k=3\\) from the posterior distribution, \\(\\mathbf{x}_{3}\\sim p(\\mathbf{x}_{3}\\vert \\mathbf{y}^\\mathrm{o}_{1:3})\\), for the state conditioned on the observed time-lapse data, and from the distribution for the permeability, \\(K\\sim p(K)\\). To find the optimized injection rate, we first calculate for each sample, \\(K\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(m)}_{3}\\), the optimized injectivity by \\(\\max_{q_3} q_3\\Delta t \\ \\ \\text{subject to} \\ \\ \\mathbf{x}_{4}['p']&lt;\\mathbf{p}_{\\max}\\) where \\(\\mathbf{p}_{\\max}\\) is the depth-dependent fracture pressure, and \\(\\mathbf{x}_{4}=\\mathcal{M}_3(\\mathbf{x}_{3}, \\mathbf{K}; q_3)\\) the state’s time-advancement denoted by the symbol \\(\\mathcal{M}_3\\). For the fluid-flow simulations, the open-source Julia package JUDI.jl and JutulDarcy.jl are used. Results of these optimizations are included in Figure 2(a), which contains a histogram of the empirical fracture frequency as a function of injection rates at time \\(k=3\\). Given this histogram, our task is to maximize the injection rate given a pre-defined confidence interval (e.g. 95 %), so that the fracture probability remains below a certain percentage e.g. 1%. With these simulations, and the fact that fracture/no-fracture occurrences are distributed according to the Bernoulli distribution, we will demonstrate that we are able to select an injection rate that limits fracture occurrence to the prescribed probability with a prescribed confidence interval. For instance, we can compute \\(Pr([\\mathbf{x}_4['p']&gt;p_{\\max}]&lt;0.01)&lt;1-0.025\\), which corresponds to selecting an injection rate that leads to fracture rate of \\(&lt;1\\%\\) with \\(97.5\\%\\) confidence. The confidence interval is halved, because only conservative (left) injection rates will be selected (see Figure 2(b))."

    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\nTo calculate injection rates that mitigate the risk of exceeding the fracture pressure, we proceed as follows. First, because the optimized injection rates are close to the fracture pressure, we consider these optimization as approximations to the injection rates where the fracture pressure are exceeded. Next, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is applied to produce the smooth red curve in Figure 2(a). This smoothed probability function is used to calculate the Cumulative Density Function (CDF), plotted in Figure 2(b). Using the fact that non-fracture/fracture occurrence entails a Bernoulli distribution, confidence intervals can be calculated, \\(\\pm Z_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{128}}\\) where \\(\\hat{p}\\) represents the CDF (blue line) and \\(Z_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}=1.96\\) with \\(\\alpha=0.05\\). From the CDF and confidence intervals (denoted by the grey areas), the following conclusions can be drawn: First, if the initial injection rate of \\(q_3 = 0.0500 m^3/s\\) is kept, the fracture probability lies between 24.47 – 40.71% (vertical dashed line) and has a maximum likelihood of 32.59%, which are all way too high. Second, if we want to limit the fracture occurrence rate to 1% (red dashed line), then we need to lower the injection rate to \\(q_3=0.0387\\mathrm{m^3/s}\\). To ensure the low fracture occurrence rate of 1%, the reduced injection rate is chosen as the smallest injection rate within the confidence interval. As can be observed from Figure 2(b), lowering the injection rate avoids exceeding the fracture pressure at the expense of injecting less CO2. Out of 128 samples, 43 samples are fractured with the initial injection rate, while only one sample is fractured with the controlled injection rate."

    "text": "Conclusion and discussions\nThe above example illustrates how Digital Twins can be used to mitigate risks associated with CO2 storage projects. Specifically, we used the Digital Twin’s capability to produce samples of its state (pressure), conditioned on observed seismic and/or well data. Using these samples, in conjunction with samples from the permeability distribution, we were able to capture statistics on the fracture occurrence frequency as a function of the injection rate. Given these statistics, we were in a position to set a fracture frequency and choose the corresponding injection rate as a function of the confidence interval. By following this procedure, exceeding the fracture pressure was avoided by lowering the injection rate. The decision to lower the injection rate, and by which amount, was informed by the Digital Twin, which uses seismic and/or well data to capture reservoir’s state including its uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Pressure state at time-step \\(k=3\\) and a comparative analysis of pressure outputs from the digital twin at time-step \\(k=4\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Injection rate samples and KDE curve(a), CDF curve of fracture probability versus injection rate with 95% confidence interval(b)"

    "text": "Amortized variational inference\nOur method concerns estimation of migration-velocity models from noisy seismic data through the inversion of the wave modeling operator. Instead of seeking only a single velocity model, our method aims to draw samples from the posterior distribution of migration-velocity models conditioned on the observed shot data. In this context, we train conditional normalizing flows (CNFs) to approximate this posterior distribution. To simplify the mapping between seismic image and shot data, we use common-image gathers (CIGs) as an information-preserving physics-informed summary statistic to embed the shot data, and then train the CNFs on pairs of velocity models and CIGs. After training, the inverse of CNF turns random realizations of the standard Gaussian distribution into posterior samples (velocity models) conditioned on any seismic observation that is in the same statistical distribution as the training data, shown in the upper part of the flowchart. We term this amortized inference framework WISE, short for full-Waveform variational Inference via Subsurface Extensions (Yin et al. 2023). We further propose a physics-based Refinement approach to make it WISER.",

    "text": "Physics-based refinement\nWhile the trained amortized CNF can generate posterior velocity samples instantaneously at inference, the accuracy of CNFs might be deteriorated due to out-of-distribution issues — i.e., the observed data is generated by an out-of-distribution velocity model, or through a slightly different forward modeling operator (e.g. acoustic-elastic, differing source function, attenuation effect, unremoved shear wave energy, etc). To meet this challenge and bridge the so-called amortization gap, we apply a physics-based refinement approach to fine-tune the trained network. We compose a shallower invertible network with the trained CNFs, where the shallower network is initialized with random weights and acts on the latent space. Following a transfer learning scheme, we freeze the weights of the trained CNF and only update the weights of the shallower network in order for the posterior samples to fit the observed shot data. This process is shown in the lower part of the flowchart in red color.",
