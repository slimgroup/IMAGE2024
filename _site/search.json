    "text": "During time-lapse seismic monitoring, weak 4D signal below the level of inversion or migration artifacts poses challenges. To address these, low-cost randomized non-replicated acquisitions and linear joint recovery model (JRM) have been introduced to take advantage of the shared information between different vintages in the time-lapse seismic data and subsurface structure undergoing localized changes. Since the relationship between seismic data and subsurface properties is seldomly linear, we propose a more versatile nonlinear JRM to invert for the squared slowness of the vintages."

    "text": "Methods, Procedures, Process\nDuring linear JRM, for two seismic vintages, three unknown parameters are inverted, namely the common component, \\(m_0\\), and innovation components, \\(\\delta m_1\\) and \\(\\delta m_2\\), with respect to this common component and there is a linear relationship between these components and seismic data. We proposed here an alternative nonlinear JRM (nJRM) that take advantage of the full nonlinear relation between these components and time-lapse data through the wave equation. We then minimize a joint misfit that takes full advantage of the shared information in the background model as shown in Figure 1. Additionally, careful derivation of the gradient shows that only one gradient computation per vintage is necessary making the computational cost equivalent to independent recovery. To demonstrate the advantage of the proposed nonlinear joint inversion, we consider an experimental setup involving CO2 monitoring and consider the seismic time-lapse in the subsurface incurred by a CO2 reservoir and use a realistic synthetic model representing North Sea (Figure 1(a)). We invert two vintages with the proposed nJRM to obtain baseline and monitor images and their difference gives the time-lapse change due to CO2 plume. Similar to the conventional linear method, nJRM should trivially extend to more than two vintages as well. Finally, we show the robustness of our method against non replicated acquisition compared to traditional independent recovery known to rely heavily on replication."

We observe that both the baseline and monitor are well recovered individually. In Figures 2 (a), (b) and (c) we show the ground truth time-lapse, independent recovery time-lapse and nJRM time-lapse difference respectively for a non-replicated acquisition, mimicking sparse OBNs, highlighted with red/green dots on the model. In these figures, time-lapse differences inverted with nonlinear JRM are more accurate and contain less artifacts and noise thanks to exploiting common information between surveys (the background model) and small localized time-lapse differences. Moreover, independent recovery suffers consequently from non-replication with clear artifacts in the shallow area (Figure 2(b)) while nonlinear JRM stays relatively focused on the time-lapse difference with dimmer and less structured artifacts. These results are consistent with the linear JRM literature, strengthens the argument for a low-cost randomized non-replicated acquisition in the time-lapse seismic survey for GCS rather than expensive replicated surveys. Finally, we measure the degree of repeatability of the recovery of the vintages and their time-lapse difference with the traditional normalized root mean square (NRMS). In this study, the NRMS value for the independent and nJRM recoveries are 1.05% and 0.46%, respectively showing a clear advantage for joint recovery."

    "text": "Methods, Procedures, Process\n\nTo create a suitable training set, we derive permeability models from 2D proxy velocity models with a geology representative of potential GCS sites in the South of the North Sea. These models are derived from 3D imaged seismic and well-log data with realistic heterogeneity. Given these permeability models, we create a training set of seismically imaged CO2 plumes that behave regularly (without leakage) and irregularly (with leakage). After generating baseline and monitor surveys, time-lapse seismic images of the plume are created with reverse time migration (RTM). The CO2 plumes themselves are modeled with two-phase flow equations.\nTo create high-fidelity images, we deploy 162 receivers (25m apart) and 32 jittered sources (~125m apart). Given these images, we train our neural classifier based on a Vision Transformer network. As shown in Figure 1a, the classifier meets our ultimate purpose of distinguishing between regular and irregular plumes.\nWhile the results are encouraging, the training and test images use high-fidelity imaging obtained with densely sampled OBNs. Unfortunately, in practice, we can not rely on dense receiver sampling due to the associated high costs and classifier performance deteriorates on images obtained from coarse receiver samplings. To overcome these issues, we augment the training dataset with time-lapse images computed from multiple acquisition geometries with coarse receiver samplings (between 25m and 200m spacing), shown in Figure 2b.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Training procedure and results of RTM on different receiver configurations.

To compensate for this performance loss, we augment the training dataset with time-lapse difference images obtained from migrating the coarse datasets with between 20 and 160 random receivers.\nWe observe in Figure 2 that the network trained with the augmented dataset, containing those time-lapse images, provides higher accuracy for all receiver geometries and better robustness to coarse acquisition.

We convert the wavespeed in the model to log-permeability values to make up alternating high- and low-permeability layers in the reservoir with a seal on top. We inject CO2 in a highly permeable layer for 25 years. During and after injection, the CO2 tends to move into high permeability layers and move up due to buoyancy effects. To monitor the CO2 plume seismically, we shoot 5 surveys of crosswell data every 5th year, using a Ricker wavelet with a central frequency of 20 Hz.\nWe start the inversion with homogenous permeability values in the reservoir. After 10 data passes of gradient descent, the CO2 plume recovery from the inverted permeability is shown in Figure 2(a). The extent of the plume looks drastically different from the initial prediction based on the homogeneous permeability, but reasonably similar to the ground truth CO2 plumes. As expected, we only obtain information on the permeability from regions within the CO2 plume during the first 25 years of injection, shown in Figure 2(b). While the inverted permeability captures only part of the true permeability model, it improves drastically on plume forecasts for the next 25 years compared to those obtained from the starting model for the permeability.

Generative networks can be used to sample models that are conditioned on observations. A particular class of generative networks are normalizing flows. These are particularly attractive because they are fast to sample from and have low training memory requirements from their invertibility. We implemented our architecture in Julia with InvertibleNetworks.jl.\nOur method is supervised and needs training examples of observed wells “y” with its corresponding full earth models “x”. We use the 3D Compass model with a 90%/5%/5% train/validate/test split of 2D slices. For each training slice (nz=256, nx=512, d=10m) of the Compass volume, we randomly generate well observations by selecting 5 horizontal locations at least 200 meters from each other. This process creates the training pairs (x_i,y_i) for the normalizing flow. We made 10k pairs and trained as visualized in Figure 1. \nAfter training, we input an unseen well log y (5 wells) and produce posterior samples p(x|y) (earth models). To create a single point estimate, we average all posterior samples to get the posterior mean.\nOur baseline, is an exponential variogram from the package PyKrige.

Our unsupervised approach eliminates the need for true models, making the technique applicable in practice, by minimizing the difference between the observed data and the migrated-demigrated supershots.

The one-shot imaging result is also better than conventional sequential source RTM since it is closer to the true reflectivity plotted at the top of the right column. This improvement in the image’s frequency content can be explained by the fact that in the supervised learning formulation the networks are jointly trained to produce broadband seismic images. Similarly, we find that similar observations are true for the unsupervised case, except that the improvement in image quality is slightly less pronounced.

    "text": "Methodology\nHere we present our formulation for a learned simultaneous source-data pair for seismic imaging. We propose two training formulations, one that relies on knowledge of the true perturbation (supervised), and the other that solely relies on the observed data (unsupervised). Fundamentally, we are introducing a formulation that learns a single supershot and corresponding source that maximally informs seismic imaging. Next section describes the design of the deep networks that enable this goal.\n\nSummary networks\nTo handle the high-dimensionality of seismic data and, we use summary networks (Radev et al. 2020) that are designed to exploit the intrinsic low-dimensional structure [ref needed to curvelet etc] of seismic data. These deep networks compress the observed seismic data \\(\\mathbf{d}\\) while maximally preserving the information useful for inferring the unknown seismic image \\(\\delta \\mathbf{m}\\). A major aspect of the architectural design of a summary networks are exploiting the invariances in data, e.g., invariance to permutation (Bloem-Reddy and Teh 2020). This is achieved by choosing neural architectures with functional forms that explicitly respect the intrinsic invariances in data. For example in the case of seismic imaging, the order of shot records has no effect on the final seismic image. To make this invariance explicit in the design of our network, we sum the shot records and feed it to a deep convolutional neural network.\n\n\nSupervised\nThe simplest formulation aims to learn the supershot and simultaneous source that best inform the model perturbation, given the surface recorded data. Mathematically, it means that we are trying to fit the true model perturbation with two networks that learn a single supershot and simultaneous source for the Jacobian from the individual field recorded shot records. Mathematically, the learning can be written as: \\[\n\\min_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\phi}} \\ \\mathbb{E}_{(\\mathbf{d}, \\delta \\mathbf{m}) \\sim p(\\mathbf{d}, \\delta \\mathbf{m})} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} \\Big\\| \\mathbf{J}\\big(\\mathcal{H}_{\\phi} \\circ \\mathcal{G}_{\\theta} \\left(\\mathbf{d}\\right)\\big)^\\top \\mathcal{G}_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{d}) - \\delta \\mathbf{m} \\Big\\|_2^2 \\right],\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathcal{G}_{\\theta}\\) is the summary network that maps shot records to a learned, nonlinearly mixed supershot at the receiver locations, \\(\\mathcal{H}_{\\phi}\\) is the neural network responsible for estimating the associated nonlinearly encoded simultaneous source, and \\(\\circ\\) is the composition operator. The objective function matches the predicted seismic image, obtained by migrating the supershot \\(\\mathcal{G}_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{d})\\) via the adjoint Born imaging operator, \\(\\mathbf{J}\\), to the ground truth seismic image \\(\\delta \\mathbf{m}\\). We note that to evaluate the gradient of the objective function with jointly respect to \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\), the gradient of the Jacobian with respect to its input (nonlinearly encoded source) is required. This derivative is, however, trivial to obtain with JUDI.jl thanks to its high-level linear algebra abstraction and integration with automatic differentiation framework in Julia.\n\n\nUnsupervised\nTo extend our approach to more realistic settings, we propose an unsupervised learning one-shot imaging approach that only requires a dataset of seismic shot records from several surveys. We formulate the problem as a minimization of the following objective function:\n\\[\n\\min_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\phi}} \\ \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{d} \\sim p(\\mathbf{d})} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} \\Big\\|  \\tilde{\\mathbf{J}} \\mathbf{J}\\big(\\mathcal{H}_{\\phi} \\circ \\mathcal{G}_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{d})\\big)^\\top \\mathcal{G}_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{d}) - \\tilde{\\mathbf{d}} \\Big\\|_2^2  \\right ],\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{d}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{\\text{src}}} w_i \\mathbf{d}_{i}\\) is a random super shot with \\(w_i := \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\\) and \\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{J}}\\) is the corresponding simultaneous source born modeling operator. While this formulation ivolves an additional demigration (and therfore and additional migration to compute hte gradient), we do not require any knowledge of the true model perturbation but only the data. We could therefore in theory use this formulation for a wide range of datasets at once to generalize to any survey."

We then split this dataset into 1600 slices for trainng and 400 slices for testing. For each 2D slice, we generate 21 shot records. One of the main advantage of our one-shot imaging method is that we only require a single migration-demigration per iteration. Therefore, we can perform 21 epochs before arriving to a computationnal cost equivalent to the plain standard RTM imaging of each slice. Since we only perform 15 epochs, our method is overall cheapper than computing the RTM on every single shot if we include the cost of training.\nWe trained the networks, both in the supervised and unsupervised case, for 15 epochs with a learning rate of \\(.0004\\) using the Adam optimizer."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Probabilistic approaches to Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI), such as Bayesian ones, traditionally require expensive computations involving many wave-equation solves. To reduce the computational burden at test time, we propose to amortize the computational cost with offline training. After training, we aim to efficiently generate probabilistic FWI solutions with uncertainty. This aim is achieved by exploiting the ability of networks (i.e Normalizing Flows) to learn distributions, such as the Bayesian posterior. The posterior uncertainty is used during training to optimize the receiver sampling.\n\n\n\n\nNormalizing flows (NFs) are generative networks that can learn to sample from conditional distributions, here our desired Bayesian posterior p(x|y) where x are earth models and y is seismic data. To train NFs, we require training pairs of those earth models and seismic data. We use pairs from the open source dataset OPENFWI. The earth models are .7km by .7km and the seismic data is simulated with 5 sources with 15Hz frequency and 20dB noise. We use the CurveFault_B dataset from OPENFWI that contains 55k pairs and split the pairs for training, validation, and testing 90%/5%/5% respectively.\nTo learn to sample from the conditional distribution, the network learns to transform the earth models to Gaussian normal noise while conditioned on the acoustic data. By construction the network is invertible, thus after training we sample Gaussian normal noise and apply the inverse network to generate samples from the posterior, again conditioned by the seismic data. The training and testing processes are illustrated schematically in Figure 1.\nThe NF training objective has been shown to be equivalent to maximizing the information gain, as defined by Bayesian optimal experimental design (EOD), of the conditioned data. Thus, we propose to jointly optimize for a receiver sampling mask M and the network parameters during NF training to simultaneously learn the Bayesian posterior and the optimal minimal receiver geometry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Schematic of full training process and test time evaluation of our method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter training, our method generates posterior samples at the cost of one network inverse pass (10ms on our GPU). Seen in Figure 2, the posterior samples are realistic earth models that could plausibly correspond to the seismic data. The variations between the posterior samples are due to the FWI problem being ill-posed and because of noise in the indirect observations at the surface (20dB noise). To study these variations, we take the sample variance as our uncertainty quantification (UQ). We observe that the UQ is concentrated on steep and deeper structures. Both these types of structures are difficult to invert for with FWI showing that our UQ correlates with the expected error making our UQ realistic and interpretable.\nTo make a single high-quality solution, we take the mean of the posterior samples. This posterior mean \\(\\mathbf{x}_{PM}\\) shows high-quality metrics that surpass OPENFWI benchmarks while producing Bayesian UQ not available with the OPENFWI benchmarks.\nThe optimal receiver sampling obtained by our method (black circles in “test” portion of Figure 1) are the traces that the network has learned to select to best inform the inverse problem.\nOur method is amortized since the aforementioned computational debt of probabilistic FWI is paid by modeling the training pairs (x,y) and the cost of training the network. After these costs are incurred offline, our method can efficiently sample from the Bayesian posterior for many unseen seismic datasets without wave-equation solves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Results from our method. Our method produces realistic samples of earth models that when averaged produce high quality point estimates. The variance in posterior samples correlates with structures that are difficult to invert for in FWI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of normalizing flows applied to amortized FWI with Bayesian uncertainty quantification. We also showed a practical application of the uncertainty towards optimal experimental design of acquisition geometry. While the open source dataset used has small models, NFs are memory efficient due to their intrinsic invertibility and are set to scale to realistic sized problems and field datasets."

    "text": "Methods, Procedures, Process (1500 characters)\nThe spectral gap ratio is the ratio of the first and second singular values of a binary subsampling mask (binary matrix). It is a cheap-to-compute measure to predict wavefield reconstruction quality from acquisition geometry only. Motivated by recent success on 2D survey design methods driven by spectral gap ratio minimization, we consider 3D survey design where receivers are missing and sources are fully sampled. Because 3D wavefield reconstruction based on low-rank matrix completion relies on the non-canonical Source-X/Receiver-X (columns) Source-Y/Receiver-Y (rows) organization of the data into a matrix, we aim to minimize the spectral gap ratio of the subsampling mask in that domain. Fortunately, when sources are fully sampled, each single-receiver block of the global sampling matrix is either fully sampled or empty depending on whether that specific receiver is sampled. Consequently, the block structure of the global matrix leads to the exact same singular values as a single-source receiver sampling mask. We can therefore optimize a single-source mask to obtain the global optimized mask. The main computational cost is computing the first two singular values of the receiver sampling mask, which is negligible compared to approaches that require wave simulations. The resulting optimal mask with the lowest spectral gap ratio indicates the receiver sampling locations that favor 3D wavefield reconstruction via matrix completion in the non-cononical organization domain."

The distance between the adjacent sources and receivers are 150m and 25m in each direction, respectively, with a time sampling interval of 0.01s. By removing 90% of receivers using jittered subsampling, we obtain a binary matrix with the spectral gap ratio 0.507 in the non-canonical domain. After applying simulated annealing algorithm, the spectral gap ratio of mask effectively decreases to 0.328. To validate the efficacy of our acquisition design method, we perform data reconstruction on a frequency slice at 16.8Hz via weighted matrix completion for the two subsampled datasets with jittered subsampling mask and the proposed mask, with results shown in Figure 2. The reconstruction signal-to-noise ratio from the observed data at proposed receiver locations is 12.27 dB, which is about 1.4 dB higher than the reconstruction signal-to-noise ratio 10.88 dB achieved from data observed at jittered sampled receiver locations. This confirms that the proposed optimized receiver sampling locations result in a superior seismic survey that leads to better wavefield reconstruction performance.

The method proceeds by generating training pairs consisting of the current CO2 saturation, which is simulated with a random injection rate from the previous timestep, and the associated reverse-time migration seismic image computed from simulated surface data. Given these training pairs, an amortized conditional normalizing flow (NF) is trained to approximate the posterior distribution for the saturation given seismic images. After training, the network is capable of drawing samples from the posterior distribution of the saturation given observed time-lapse seismic data at the current timestep. In turn, these samples for the CO2 saturation serve as input to two-phase flow simulations to predict the CO2 plume at the next timestep and the process repeats itself, recursively.\nCompared to more traditional data assimilation techniques, our approach has the distinct advantage that it does not make simplifying assumptions on the statistics and linearity of the CO2 plume dynamics and its coupling to time-lapse seismic data. The proposed method is also likelihood free. It only needs to be able to run simulations of the plume dynamics that may contain hidden stochastic terms.

Figure 2 shows that seismic-conditioned predictions are more accurate in predicting the ground truth and have a smaller conditional sample variance than the unconditioned ensemble mean predictions.\nBy examining the difference between the ground truth and predictions, we characterize the uncertainties. For the seismic-conditioned predictions, the uncertainties are located near the injection well. In addition, the plume’s boundary is well-predicted by the seismic-conditioned method while the unconditioned simulations have, as expected, an increasing uncertainty at the boundary over time and tend to consistently over-estimate the plume extent.\nOverall, we conclude that the unconditioned simulation poorly predicts the CO2 plume.
